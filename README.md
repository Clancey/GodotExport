# Godot Scene Exporter

I really wanted an easy way to export a scene and all of the dependencies.
Enable the addon, then use Project -> Tools -> Export Resource. Choose the scene and then choose the output directory. 

I also got extremly tired of UID errors.
So Project -> Tools -> Fix Resource UID Errors
And all your UID errors will go away!
